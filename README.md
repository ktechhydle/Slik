# Slik
Slik is our custom IDE, built entirely for MP Software developers.

<img src="resources/screenshots/slik_startup.png" style="border-radius: 5px; width: 100%;">

## Overview
Slik is based on three key points:

1. Fully Automatic:
> Slik will detect virtual environments, main entrypoints, and index file system changes.

2. Optimized For Success
> Slik uses a GUI implemented in PyQt, with a Rust backend handling the majority of IDE related tasks.

3. Hidden Until You Need It
> Slik's user interface is task specific, with dialogs being activated by key strokes _(try `Ctrl+Q` to see the file browser!)_

## Free And Open Source
Slik is 100% free with no drawbacks or limitations. There is no "premium" version; you get the latest and greatest,
all licensed under the GPL. Slik only has prebuilt binaries for Windows (as it is our primary development platform)
but can be ran on other machines by cloning this repository.
