# Slik
Python and Rust combined just work _good_. You get speed with simplicity, so why not use the IDE built for it?

## Overview
Slik is the IDE for Rust and Python devs alike.

- **Creative UI** Slik's user interface is task specific, with all dialogs being activated by key strokes. This means code focus without the distraction of multiple widgets and windows.
- **Built-In Support** Slik doesn't need an extension to run Python or Rust, it's built in!
- **No IDE directory** Slik doesn't need ".vscode" like directories for IDE specific features. This frees up project space and keeps your codebase clean.

## Free And Open Source
Slik is 100% free with no drawbacks or limitations. There is no "premium" version; you get the latest and greatest,
all licensed under the GPL. Slik currently only supports Windows, but can be run on macOS and Linux by cloning this
repository.
