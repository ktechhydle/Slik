# Slik
Originally started as a personal project, Slik _is_ the IDE for MP Software developers.

## Overview
Slik is based on three key points:

1. Fully Automatic: 
> Slik will detect virtual environments, main entrypoints, and index file system changes.

2. Optimized And Quick
> Slik uses a GUI implemented in PyQt, with a Rust backend handling the majority of IDE related tasks.

3. Hidden Until You Need It
> Slik's user interface is task specific, with dialogs being activated by key strokes _(try `Ctrl+Q` to see the file browser!)_

- **Creative UI** Slik's user interface is task specific, with all dialogs being activated by key strokes. This means code focus without the distraction of multiple widgets and windows.
- **Auto Runner** Slik will automatically detect a main entrypoint and run code from there.
- **No IDE directory** Slik doesn't need ".vscode" like directories for IDE specific features.

## Free And Open Source
Slik is 100% free with no drawbacks or limitations. There is no "premium" version; you get the latest and greatest,
all licensed under the GPL. Slik currently only supports Windows, but can be run on macOS and Linux by cloning this
repository.
