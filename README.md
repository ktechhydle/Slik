# Slik
In our eyes, IDEs these days aren't really evolving. That's why we build Slik.

## Overview
Slik combines the best of all worlds with:

- **Creative UI** Slik's user interface is simple, with all dialogs being hidden for later use.
- **Multi-Language Support** Slik supports Python, Rust, C++, HTML, and CSS. Language support is always growing!
- **Automatic Runner** Slik can run supported languages automatically on the click of a button.

## The UI
Slik's UI is designed to be minimal. Upon opening, its just a tabbed editor and a terminal,
but it's deeper than that. 

The project file browser is hidden until you want to access it! This allows code focus,
while ease of switching through files.
