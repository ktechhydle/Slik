# Slik
In our eyes, IDEs these days aren't really evolving. That's why we built Slik.

## Overview
Slik combines the best of all worlds with:

- **Creative UI** Slik's user interface is simple, with all dialogs being hidden for later use.
- **Multi-Language Support** Slik supports Python, Rust, HTML, and CSS. Language support is always growing!
- **Automatic Runner** Slik can run supported languages automatically on the click of a button.

## The UI
Slik's UI is designed to be minimal. Upon opening, its just a tabbed editor and a terminal,
but it's deeper than that. 

The project file browser is hidden until you want to access it! This allows code focus,
while ease of switching through files. 

## Language Support
Slik is best built for Python and Rust, but we will be adding more language support with each update.

## Auto Run

## Free And Open Source
Slik is 100% free with no drawbacks or limitations. There is no "premium" version; you get the latest and greatest, 
all licensed under the GPL. Slik currently only supports Windows, but can be run on macOS and Linux by cloning this 
repository.
