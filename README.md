# Slik
In our eyes, IDEs these days aren't really evolving. That's why we built Slik.

## Overview
Slik combines the best of all worlds with:

- **Creative UI** Slik's user interface is simple, with all dialogs being hidden for later use.
- **Multi-Language Support** Slik primarily supports Python and Rust.
- **Automatic Runner** Slik can run supported languages automatically at the click of a button.

## Free And Open Source
Slik is 100% free with no drawbacks or limitations. There is no "premium" version; you get the latest and greatest, 
all licensed under the GPL. Slik currently only supports Windows, but can be run on macOS and Linux by cloning this 
repository.
